## Overview

A fluid simulation written in C++ using SFML based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSKMYc1CQHE&t=2480s">Sebastian Lague's tutorial</a>.

# Download

To explore the simulation, download the binary from the `release` section.

## Steps to build from source

Use cmake to build project.

```
// Clone the repo and use following commands
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

This will generate the required files to setup the project
Using Clang to compile will dramatically increase speed. The binaries in `Release` have been compiled using Clang++
